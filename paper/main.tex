\begin{abstract}
The spread of misinformation on social networks threatens societal stability by shaping public opinion and collective action. This paper develops a game-theoretic model in which agents, motivated by reputational rewards, interact with information and update their actions over time. These actions are applied to a structured social network where diffusion is governed by agents’ influence and reach. By capturing how individual decisions aggregate across diverse topologies, the model quantifies contamination rates within neighborhoods after repeated updates, highlighting how utility-driven behaviors shape the velocity and extent of misinformation spread.
